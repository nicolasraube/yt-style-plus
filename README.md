# yt-style-plus
YouTube theme for the "Stylish" browser extension.
You can add yt-style-plus to Stylish here: [https://userstyles.org/styles/145513/youtube-style-plus](https://userstyles.org/styles/145513/youtube-style-plus)

# Features
The main feature is a **wider theater mode** that spans 100% of the width of your device and almost 100% of the height. The **search bar** is **reduced in height** so it takes up as little space as possible.

The style also improves the look of:
- comments
- thumbnails
- subscribe button
- like/dislike button
- like bar
- verified badge
- video has subtle rounded corners if theater mode is deactivated and not fullscreen

Increased font size for:
- video time
- title
- view count
- playlist index
